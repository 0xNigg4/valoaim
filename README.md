## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores how an Arduino board (Leonardo or Pro Micro) can be used to simulate human-like mouse movements. While it resembles the behavior of an "aim assist," it's intended strictly for learning about **Human Interface Devices (HID)**, **input automation**, and **anti-cheat detection strategies** in gaming environments.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To understand:
- How hardware can simulate mouse input
- The mechanics behind precise aiming in FPS games
- How anti-cheat systems may detect unnatural input patterns
- The importance of ethics and responsible use of such knowledge
